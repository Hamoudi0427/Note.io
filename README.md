# What is Note.io :grey_question:
 Whether it’s a key stakeholder which missed a meeting, or if you need to loop in other colleagues, Note.io, a chrome extension that interfaces with platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Google Meets, Zoom, provides users with automatic transcription of meeting notes that are summarized, shareable, searchable, and readily accessible to team members. Our meeting transcription solution helps teams work better, together. <br /> 
# Demo :computer:
With Note.io, your video meeting transcripts enable your team to instantly find, access, and interact with the information they need – without wasting time scanning through hours of video. <br /> <br />
Also, transcribing video meetings shouldn’t be a painful process. With Note.io auto transcription feature, all of your meetings are automatically transcribed, and made discoverable in a directory – without any additional work from you. <br /> <br />
In addition, with Note.io you can easily access, review, and collaborate on your transcripts in a shared directory on the platform of your choice, allowing you to post follow-up questions, and mention colleagues directly in the transcript. <br /> <br />
Lastly, accuracy is essential to a useful meeting transcript, but many built-in transcription tools are unable to adapt well to different topics or accents. Note.io uses an AI-powered speech recognition engine to deliver highly accurate meeting transcripts. <br /> <br />
